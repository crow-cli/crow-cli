* reader suspended on the promise inside that boundary would otherwise wait
* forever. There is no hide signal to release it sooner: React cleans up
* layout effects in hidden content, but tap does not pass that through to this
* hook (a layout effect cleanup here ran only on unmount when tested). The
* value is a bound on that wait, not a tuned delay.

* waits for it. The wait ends after `COMMIT_TIMEOUT_MS`, and at once after
* unmount. Each source promise maps to one delayed promise, keeping it stable
* for `use()` and Suspense caches. `getLatestState` must be stable.
